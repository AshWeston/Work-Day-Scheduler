Hi There, 

Follow this link to my Work Day Scheduler - https://ashweston.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/

This is an interactive planner, that will allow you to edit and set tasks throughout the day. The application displays timeblocks for longer business hours. (9 a.m. to 8p.m.).

Simply enter the task in the relevant time slot, and click save. Any changes you have made will save on refresh.

You can also see that time slots are color-coded for easy tracking. Grey is in the past, red is the current hour, and green is any time in the future.

I hope you wil find this useful!
